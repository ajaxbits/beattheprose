## Hacker, Design, Linux, Empathy

Hey! I'm Alex Jackson. I care about _people_ and how they use technology.

I'm on a journey to safeguard those who need help, enable those without a voice, and make life easier every day.

I'm here to learn and work toward a better future.

I'm new to the game, but really fired up about making tech work for people. I really want to get started contributing and making the world better. If you have a project that looks like it needs my skills, my DMs are always open.

### My Websites
